When we introduce a probabilty to a action, we actually loose significant amount of information.
The agent might take more actions to reach the final state. Which may imply a longer path.

The effect of probabilty will show as, if we increase the probabilty of correct action, the path may get closer to the shortest path and reverse when it is lower
